Proyect Mess, 
Inside HerramientaResumenes:
-js -> class.js, SummaryBuilder.js (this files, may change hopefully to the better) and nouislider.min.js (library, not mine dont remenber from where but i think its online to this date 31/12/2024).
-css -> yet containt only the library mentioned earlier, may add or move here css.
-trastos -> where I did some first tries and put some obsolete trash, might delete later.
-views -> the important one is the form prueba.html (to rename it though), the others have not any html form and you have to hardcode contents to create schemes, tables, everything.
-ax.txt -> to do some manual testing copy pasting
-the html file should be move into trastos or deleted
-and the other is a link i found interestings about events (a random answer i should save just in case)
